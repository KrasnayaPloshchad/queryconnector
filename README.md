####Note:

**Starting from 1.3.1 version, I think that exception problem during the execution of any of the men√π action provided within the extension has been definitely solved. (Example: (http://it.libreofficeforum.org/node/7257)). Unfortunately, this error, doesn't occurs sistematically and it's hard to find and fix. Please report an issue if the problem persists.**
